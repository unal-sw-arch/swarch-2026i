## 🎯 Course Purpose

The goal of this course is to design and analyze architectural structures for complex software systems, ensuring alignment with key **quality attributes** such as security, performance, scalability, reliability, interoperability, and evolvability.

This repository reflects a practical application of architectural concepts, patterns, tactics, and styles studied during the course.

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes Reflected in This Repository

By working on the projects in this repository, we aim to:

- Analyze architectural structures and their influence on the organization and behavior of software systems.
- Evaluate the impact of architectural decisions on software quality attributes.
- Select and justify architectural styles based on functional and non-functional requirements.
- Apply architectural patterns and tactics to address recurring design problems.
- Document software architectures using multiple architectural views.
- Implement software systems consistent with their architectural designs.

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized according to the course projects and iterations:

```
/
├── prototype-1/   # Simple architectural structure
├── prototype-2/   # Advanced architectural structure
├── prototype-3/   # Quality attributes – Part 1
├── prototype-4/   # Quality attributes – Part 2
└── README.md
```

Each project folder may include:

- Architectural descriptions
- Design decisions and rationale
- Diagrams (C&C, deployment, layered, etc.)
- Source code and configuration files (when applicable)

---

## 🤝 Collaboration Guidelines

- All contributions must be made through **pull requests**.
- Changes should be small, clear, and focused.
- Commit messages must be written in English and explain _what_ was changed and _why_.
- Team members should respect different opinions and architectural perspectives.
- All work must be original; plagiarism is strictly forbidden.
